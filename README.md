## Hello, my name is Xamintosh (foxthing)
☺️
Here are a few things about me:

***
1. I like eating foreign and local foods (not picky).
2. I use the `EMACS` text editor, aka the best ***FOSS*** software.
3. I'm teaching myself `org` and `markdown`.
4. I prefer Linux over Windows.
5. I mainly use `Debian Linux`.
6. I need to work on my typing speed.

### Some new years goals of mine:

- Install Gentoo on something.
- Make my home smart with local devices and ***NO*** cloud services except maybe a `vps`.
- Become a amateur developer with *maybe* even a first employment in the `development` field.
- Write a decent `Python` project and publish it.
